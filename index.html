<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Binge-watching has been around since the late 1990s, but started to gain popularity in the mid- to late 2000s with the availability (and accessibility) of TV shows like <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em> on streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video <span class="citation" data-cites="molla2020 thomas2021">(<a href="#ref-molla2020" role="doc-biblioref">Molla &amp; Kafka, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-thomas2021" role="doc-biblioref">Thomas &amp; Gennis, 2021</a>)</span>. However, it really took off in 2013 when Netflix began releasing original content, starting with <em>House of Cards</em> and followed later that year by <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. Netflix started the practice of releasing all episodes of a season at once, a sharp departure from the standard weekly episodes <span class="citation" data-cites="rumble2018">(<a href="#ref-rumble2018" role="doc-biblioref">Rumble, 2018</a>)</span>. They continue to release most of their content this way, with a few exceptions (<em>Love is Blind</em> and season 3 of <em>Bridgerton</em>, notably). The public seemed to love it because they could watch at their own pace and didn’t have to wait a week after a mid-season cliff-hanger <span class="citation" data-cites="mcfarland2024">(<a href="#ref-mcfarland2024" role="doc-biblioref">McFarland, 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Shows like <em>Succession</em> (2018 - 2023), <em>The Last of Us</em> (2023 - present), and <em>The White Lotus</em> (2021 - present), all of which aired weekly on HBO at the same time they were released on HBO Max (later Max), created intense online discourse and reignited appointment television for an hour each Sunday. This provided not only a way for viewers to connect with each other, but also built momentum and caused the shows to stay in the public discourse for as many weeks as they aired <span class="citation" data-cites="sutton2023">(<a href="#ref-sutton2023" role="doc-biblioref">Sutton, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As more streaming platforms came onto the market, so did more methods of releasing original content. While some shows are still released all at once (the “binge model”), many are released weekly, with some providing two or three episodes to start before transitioning to one episode a week. Some shows will also be released in batches of two episodes every week <span class="citation" data-cites="press2021">(<a href="#ref-press2021" role="doc-biblioref">Press, 2021</a>)</span>. For example, all 3 seasons of <em>The Bear</em> on Hulu have been released all at once, while season 1 of <em>Shogun</em> premiered with the first two episodes at once and then weekly.</p>
<p>With the rise of social media, platforms like Twitter became an important place to discuss TV shows with fellow viewers and get recommendations, later followed by TikTok. This project will seek to answer the question “<em>Does the release schedule of a show (weekly, in parts, or all at once) impact their staying power?</em>” Of particular interest is how shows perform on weekly Nielsen charts - both overall and by streaming platform - and their interest over time on Google Trends.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods" class="level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>In order to answer our question of interest, we had to gather a large amount of data from a wide number of various sources and databases. Unless mentioned otherwise, all of the data that was collected was data specifically about the US. Google Trends data and the ratings data all reflect the United States ratings and values; we decided to exclude worldwide ratings as we are most interested in the US Market.</p>
<section id="google-trends" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="google-trends">Google Trends</h3>
<p>Google Trends data was gathered for each show, movie, or special that appeared on any of the ratings lists that were collected. This data was gathered for a timeframe of the last 5 years for each show, regardless of when the show premiered, in order to keep our data consistent. The data for each show was downloaded in a CSV file from the Google Trends website, with two columns: Date and Rating. This data manually was gathered manually because no API exists for the Google Trends data. The ratings are on a normalized scale, where 100 is equal to the point in time that the term was searched for most often, and 0 means that the term was not searched enough to crack the threshold.</p>
<p>The main issue to overcome was in getting the ratings associated with the show, as the show’s title was not included in the CSV file. This was solved by naming each CSV file after the show or movie, and then adding a column of the file name so that we can match the ratings with the show titles.</p>
<p>In order to process such large quantities of CSV files, we organized them into folders based on the shows’ streaming platform. For example, the ‘Netflix’ folder contained the Google Trends CSVs for the shows <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>Bridgerton</em>, and <em>The Crown</em>, among others. We then set up a function in R to loop over the folders of CSVs, which ingested all of the data, added the show’s name to the dataset as a new column, and then combined all rows together. Therefore, we were left with a single CSV of Google Trends data instead of hundreds of individual CSVs.</p>
</section>
<section id="nielsen-weekly-streaming-ratings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nielsen-weekly-streaming-ratings">Nielsen Weekly Streaming Ratings</h3>
<p>Nielsen weekly steaming ratings (see current week <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">here</a>) data was collected for as far back as they go, which is September 2020. Nielsen’s website only offers the most recent release, with no archive, so they were gathered from Variety articles (<a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/nielsen-top-10-ratings-streaming-1235693657/">example</a>) or the TV Grim Reaper on Twitter/X (<a href="https://x.com/TVGrimReaper/status/1751995525032034443">example</a>). We specifically gathered the Top 10 data for Original Content; as we are mainly interested in how a streaming show’s release schedule influences its popularity, information on acquired shows that were released in other means was not information that we were interested in.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge that we encountered in processing the Nielsen Weekly Streaming data came from the form that the data was collected in. We were unable to find a CSV download for the Nielsen data (that we wouldn’t have to pay for), so we took screenshots of the Nielsen Top 10 Weekly data. Each screenshot contained the following information: the week that the ratings were from, show rank (1-10), the show’s name, the show’s SVOD Provider (streaming platform), the total number of episodes of the show, and the number of minutes that the program was watched in the past week.</p>
<p>As we had over 190 screenshots of Nielsen data, we did not wish to process this data manually. As such, we looked for ways to process these screenshots using programmatic means. A few APIs were tested to determine which could process the data the most successfully, with AWS being the best. All the images were fed through the Amazon Textract tool and downloaded as ZIP files, which contained a CSV. R was used to unzip the folders, clean the data, and merge the files together into a single CSV file. This CSV contained all of the weekly Nielsen data that was collected, with a column for the date of the rankings in order to keep each week separate.</p>
</section>
<section id="tv-grim-reaper-weekly-streaming-ratings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tv-grim-reaper-weekly-streaming-ratings">TV Grim Reaper Weekly Streaming Ratings</h3>
<p>In addition to Nielsen’s overall ratings that encompass all of the major streaming platforms, Nielsen also releases weekly top 10 ratings for each streaming platform. The Nielsen top 10 lists for individual streaming platforms came from the TV Grim Reaper on Twitter/X (<a href="https://x.com/TVGrimReaper/status/1787594943994941612">example</a>). The account is run by Bill Gorman, the co-founder of TV by the Numbers. He got the lists from a source who works at a company that subscribes to Nielsen. The TV Grim Reaper posted these screenshots starting from around June 2023 to April of 2024, so we have roughly one year’s worth of data to work with.</p>
<p>In total, we gathered ratings for the following platforms: Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+ and Hulu. We did not gather data for Netflix (see next section), and did not gather data for Peacock or Paramount+ as these platforms’ top 10 data was not captured by the TV Grim Reaper and we were unable to find any alternative means of collecting this data.</p>
<p>Screenshots were taken of each tweet, and like the Nielsen weekly ratings, were then fed through the Amazon Textract API from AWS. R was again used to unzip the folders, clean the data, and merge the files together (one for each platform).</p>
</section>
<section id="netflix-weekly-top-10-streaming-ratings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="netflix-weekly-top-10-streaming-ratings">Netflix Weekly Top 10 Streaming Ratings</h3>
<p>We did not gather Netflix Top 10 data from the TV Grim Reaper because Netflix is the only streaming platform that offers a CSV download (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/united-states/tv?week=2024-07-21">link</a>) of its entire Weekly Top 10 history (starting from August 2021 - present day). This was very beneficial to us, as it not only covered a longer period of time than the TV Grim Reaper ratings did, but it also came in a CSV download with all of the key variables and information that we were interested in, such as date, ranking, and show name.</p>
<p>Netflix’s weekly top 10 ratings include the ratings for each individual country where Netflix is available. As such, we needed to filter the dataset to only include the ratings for the United States, our country of interest. Additionally, the top 10 download includes both top 10 ratings for movies and television shows, so we had to filter out any movies from the dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="flixpatrol-yearly-streaming-ratings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="flixpatrol-yearly-streaming-ratings">FlixPatrol Yearly Streaming Ratings</h3>
<p>FlixPatrol is a movie and TV ratings compiler that provides an API to get lists of ratings, with options to filter by show type, streaming platform, countries, years, and many more options. We gathered the yearly ratings for the eight main streaming platforms that we are analyzing (Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock) for the years of 2021-2024 (which overlaps with our weekly streaming ratings data). These ratings are calculated by the total number of minute that the show was watched over the year. We had no real issues getting these into a good format as the API allowed for specifying which columns we were interested in (show, platform, rating, and date), and offered CSV downloads of our queries.</p>
<p>One issue that we had with the FlixPatrol platform was in getting top 10 data for original programming only. The API had filters to only include shows from a specific creator, but not all streaming platforms were available as filters. In order to get around this, we got the overall top 10 lists for the streamers who didn’t appear as filters (Peacock and Paramount+), and then went through the lists manually to determine if the show was original programming or not. We went through the lists starting with the top until we had 10 original shows per year.</p>
</section>
<section id="show-release-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="show-release-information">Show Release Information</h3>
<p>One of the main components of our project involves the release schedule of individual shows. To obtain this information, we compiled a list of all the shows we had data for, and using Wikipedia articles for each platform (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Amazon_Prime_Video_original_programming">example</a>), got the number of seasons for each show, as well as the release schedule for each season.</p>
<p>We binned the releases into three separate categories: all at once, hybrid, and weekly. All at once shows were shows whose entire seasons were released all at the same time. Weekly shows were shows whose episodes were released at a rate of one per week. Hybrid shows were shows whose episodes were released in some combination of all at once and weekly. A good example of this is the first season of Ted Lasso. The first three episodes were released all at once, and then the rest of the season was released at a rate of one episode per week.</p>
<p>We had to organize the show release by season because there are some shows, such as <em>Bridgerton</em>, whose release schedule changed over the course of the show’s lifetime. Seasons 1 and 2 of <em>Bridgerton</em> both released their entire seasons all at once, whereas Season 3 of <em>Bridgerton</em> released in two four-episode batches. As such, it would be misleading to classify <em>Bridgerton</em> as either a strictly ‘all at once’ or strictly ‘hybrid’ release schedule. Therefore, we decided to include each individual season to account for these scenarios of release format changes.</p>
<p>An argument can be made that Wikipedia’s information could be inaccurate. However, it was the only source that we could find that contained the release information for each individual episode of a show, whereas other sources would only contain when the season was released. Meaning, these sources would not tell us if a show was released weekly, all at once, or in a hybrid format. Furthermore, Wikipedia’s community of editors actively works to correct errors and ensure accuracy, especially within heavily trafficked articles such as popular TV shows. As such, after weighing the pros and cons, we decided we were comfortable with the potential risks of inaccuracy and decided to proceed with Wikipedia as a source of reliable information.</p>
<p>We additionally gathered whether the show was original content to the streaming platform or acquired content from a third party source. A third-party source in this context would be whatever studio created and released the show. For example, <em>Young Sheldon</em> is on Netflix, but was created by and aired on CBS. Therefore, CBS is the third-party source for <em>Young Sheldon</em>. As we are most interested in the release schedule of streaming shows, acquired shows’ release schedules did not pertain to our questions of interest and as such, we excluded these shows from our analysis.</p>
</section>
<section id="show-genre-and-language-information" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="show-genre-and-language-information">Show Genre and Language Information</h3>
<p>Another variable we were interested in was the genre of a show, and how the show’s genre can affect its popularity. To gather this information, we once again turned to Wikipedia. The show genres that are listed on Wikipedia can be extremely specific, such as the genre for the Amazon Prime Video show Gen V being listed as ‘superhero teen drama’. As one can imagine, that was the only show in the entire dataset that had that specific genre. Therefore, we knew that using the genres as they were listed on Wikipedia would not be sufficient for our needs and decided to bin the genres into their main categories.</p>
<p>We decided to bin the shows into three different genre categories: drama, comedy, and docuseries. Any show whose genre included the word <em>comedy</em>, <em>drama</em>, or <em>docuseries</em> was put into its respective category. From there, we were left with a large list of genres that we classified into the bins based on how we felt they best fit. For docuseries, we included any genre that was non-fiction or depicted real world events. This included true crime documentaries, reality competition shows, and game shows. For drama, we included any genre that was classified as a genre that is typically dramatic, such as horror, thriller, and telenovela. For comedy, we included any genre that is typically lighthearted, such as sitcoms, children’s shows, and mockumentary.</p>
<p>One important caveat: each show was classified as one of the three genre categories with only one exception. There is a small subset of shows in the dataset whose genre lists both Comedy and Drama, such as the show <em>The Bear</em>. <em>The Bear</em>’s genre was listed as ‘comedy drama’, and as such, it felt disingenuous to assign the show to a single bin. Therefore, if a show’s genre specifically had both of the words ‘comedy’ and ‘drama’, we classified the show as both a comedy and a drama. As we were essentially duplicating these shows, we separated the binned genres into a different table in our database so we don’t have duplicate shows in the shows table and can maintain having a single row for each show in our shows table.</p>
<p>We also gathered information on the language of the show. As mentioned above, we only collected the ratings for the US specifically, but as we know, the US is a melting pot of different cultures and backgrounds. This meant that there were a small, but not insignificant number of shows in our dataset whose dialogue is primarily in a foreign language. So we decided to also gather language data from Wikipedia while we were gathering the genre information.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-ethics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-ethics">Data Ethics</h2>
<p>We only looked at shows that were included in the top 10 lists calculated by Nielsen and Netflix, which does&nbsp;not paint a full picture of the streaming landscape, but rather the most popular shows in any given week. We recognize that depending on what’s released that week, if there are known and extremely popular shows with new episodes, other shows that may in any other week be included could be pushed down or off the rankings.</p>
<p>There is also bias in the types of people that tend to subscribe to different platforms. Additionally, we want to recognize the cost of streaming services, and that they are not something everyone has access to - the cheapest plans on each service range from $5.99 (ad-supported Paramount+ or Peacock) to $15.99 (ad-free HBO Max) a month <span class="citation" data-cites="moses2023">(<a href="#ref-moses2023" role="doc-biblioref">Moses, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>We decided to store our data in third normal form (3NF), and as such, assigned unique ID numbers to each show and streaming platform in the ratings. The most time consuming and tedious part of the project was in getting all of the show titles in a consistent format so that we could assign them all IDs. Many shows were listed in multiple different ways in the various ratings; for example, the Netflix show <em>Formula 1: Drive to Survive</em> was in the datasets as ‘Formula 1: Drive to Survive’, ‘FORMULA 1: DRIVE SURVIVE’, and ‘Formula One: Drive…’. This was true for many of the shows in the various datasets, so in order to ensure consistency for joining purposes, we went through the datasets and set each show name to a consistent format. This ended up being a pretty considerable effort, taking a few days’ worth of work to complete. But once we were finished, we were able to easily and consistently join our datasets together and change the show names to show ids.</p>
<p>The way that we structured our database tables is shown in the Entity Relationship Diagram of <a href="#fig-1"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We use the show_id as our main connecting piece, allowing us to connect our shows table with the various ratings tables, the gtrends table (containing Google Trends data), and the releaseinfo and binned_genres tables.</p>
<p>Instead of having unique Primary Keys for each table, we primarily use compound keys as unique identifiers for each of our tables. Only the shows and platforms tables have single value primary keys. Every other table has a compound primary key. The compound keys were chosen to have a unique identifier that we could use to identify each row. For example, the netflixtop10 table’s compound key consists of the show_id, date, and season_title. This is because Netflix’s Top 10 data breaks down a show by season, so a single show could appear on the same week’s top 10 list multiple times. An example of this is <em>Bridgerton</em>. The Netflix Top 10 list for the week of June 6, 2024 contains <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 3, <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 2, and <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 1. As such, a compound key of just the show_id and date would not create a unique compound key. Therefore, season_title was also included to differentiate between the different seasons of a show.</p>
<p>The season_number was included in the compound key of the releaseinfo table for similar reasons; as the release schedule for a show can change over the lifetime of the show, we needed to include the season_number to the compound key alongside the show_id to ensure that each row had a unique identifier.</p>
<p>Most of the other tables such as gtrends, reaperratings, yearlyratings, and nielsenratings use a compound key of just the date and show_id as they do not differentiate between seasons, and therefore each show would have at maximum one data point per week, making our compound keys unique for these tables.</p>
<p>The binned_genres table required including both the show_id and the binned_genre as part of the compound key. This is due to the fact that, as mentioned in the <strong>Show Genre</strong> section, there are a small number of shows whose genre listed both ‘comedy’ and ‘drama’, and as such, we classified them as both. Therefore, within the binned_genres table, there are a few show_ids that are repeated, so we must additionally include the binned_genre column in our compound key to ensure that each row is unique.</p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Our analysis includes exploratory data analysis, a case study, survival analysis, and a machine learning model.</p>
<section id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>After gathering all of the data we listed above, we ended up with a dataset that totalled 684 TV shows that were original content on a streaming platform. The breakdown of the shows by streaming platform is in <a href="#fig-2"><strong>Figure 2</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the breakdown of shows, it is clear to see that Netflix has considerably more shows in the dataset than any other streaming platform; in fact, it has more than all other platforms combined. This is due to two main reasons. First, Netflix’s weekly top 10 data covers a timeframe of 3.5 years, whereas the other platforms weekly top 10 data covers around 0.75 years. Therefore, we have an additional 2+ years worth of data for specifically Netflix shows than the other streaming platforms, leading to more shows. Second, Netflix is the most popular streaming platform, and as such, both has the funding to make much more original content than its counterparts and dominates the combined streaming ratings on Nielsen. According to DigitalTrends, Netflix has 270 million monthly subscribers, whereas Hulu, Max, Paramount+, and Apple TV+ all have under 100 million subscribers <span class="citation" data-cites="nickinson2024">(<a href="#ref-nickinson2024" role="doc-biblioref">Nickinson, 2024</a>)</span>. That large of a difference in revenue allows Netflix to create more original content than its competitors. Additionally, as we were only gathering data for shows that appeared on a top 10 list, Netflix’s large subscriber base helped them dominate the Nielsen rankings. And, perhaps most obviously, Netflix is the oldest streaming platform, having been launched in 2007 <span class="citation" data-cites="barnes2019">(<a href="#ref-barnes2019" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes, 2019</a>)</span>. As it is the oldest streaming service, it has also had the most time to create original content. This dominance of Netflix in our dataset will likely skew the results in favor of what is most successful for Netflix, something that we need to be aware of during our analysis.</p>
<p><a href="images/tv_shows_by_platform.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="Figure 2: Netflix dominates the dataset with the most total shows"><img src="images/tv_shows_by_platform.png" id="fig-2" class="img-fluid" width="780" alt="Figure 2: Netflix dominates the dataset with the most total shows"></a> <em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Netflix dominates the dataset with the most total shows</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The breakdown of shows by binned genre is as follows (<a href="#fig-3"><strong>Figure 3</strong></a>).</p>
<p>The distribution of shows by genre is relatively straightforward and makes sense. Initially, we were surprised by the comparatively low number of comedy shows compared with drama and even docuseries shows. However, we realized that this was due to the fact that the only shows whose data we gathered were shows that were present on a Top 10 Ranking. And as the majority of critically acclaimed TV shows are dramas in some capacity, this difference in genre counts makes sense based on our data collection methods.</p>
<p>We broke down the shows by genre because we anticipate that every release schedule will not be appropriate for every type of show. As such, we expect to see a change in the popularity of shows in given release genres depending on the show’s genre.</p>
<p><a href="images/tv_shows_by_genre.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3" title="Figure 3: Drama shows are the most common genre"><img src="images/tv_shows_by_genre.png" id="fig-3" class="img-fluid" width="780" alt="Figure 3: Drama shows are the most common genre"></a> <em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Drama shows are the most common genre</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The breakdown of shows by their release schedule is shown in <a href="#fig-4"><strong>Figure 4</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="#fig-4"><strong>Figure 4</strong></a> shows, Netflix is far and away the reason why ‘all at once’ shows dominate the dataset, having over 300 shows with that release schedule. The other streaming platforms have much more of an even distribution, but we will need to be cognizant of the Netflix domination during our analysis.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study-fallout-vs.-the-last-of-us">Case Study: <em>Fallout</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em></h2>
<p>We wanted to compare two similar shows that had different release schedules; we chose Prime Video’s <em>Fallout</em> (<a href="#fig-5"><strong>Figure 5</strong></a>) and HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> (<a href="#fig-6"><strong>Figure 6</strong></a>).</p>
<p><a href="#fig-5"><strong>Figure 5</strong></a> and <a href="#fig-6"><strong>Figure 6</strong></a> highlight the Google Trends search interest and placement on the Nielsen top 10 streaming rankings for two streaming TV shows, both post-apocalyptic dramas based on video game franchises. <em>Fallout</em> was released in full on Prime Video on April 10, 2024. <em>The Last of Us</em> premiered on HBO (simulcast on HBO Max) on January 15, 2023 and ran until March 12. <em>Fallout</em> was on the Nielsen rankings for 7 weeks, spending 4 of those at #1 before falling to #7. <em>The Last of Us</em> was on the Nielsen rankings for 9 weeks, spending just one week at #1, but fell no farther than #4. Interest for both shows peaked when they premiered, but by a week later interest in <em>Fallout</em> had fallen and it was half as popular; it continued to fall, although showing small peaks. Interest in <em>The Last of Us</em> jumped weekly as new episodes aired, not dipping below the halfway mark until almost a week after the finale.</p>

<section id="tests-and-definitions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tests-and-definitions">Tests and Definitions</h2>
<p>In the process of performing our analysis, we will be utilizing a wide range of different statistical models, tests, and techniques. To ensure clarity and understanding, we have provided these definitions below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Kaplan-Meier Curves</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kaplan-Meier curves are graphical representations of the survival probability of a given variable. They display how long it takes for an event to happen; oftentimes, this event is a “death”, such as a part breaking or a show ending. They are read as follows: say a Kaplan-Meier curve shows that variable A has a 100% survival rate at time 0, and a 50% survival rate at time 1. That means that, between time 0 and time 1, 50% of the instances of variable A in the dataset did not survive to time 1.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If there is a vertical line present, that indicates censored data. Censored data indicates an observation that has yet to encounter “death”. In the example of a survival curve of how long it takes for a part to break, if a part was observed for one week and did not break, then it would be represented as a single vertical line at the one week mark, indicating that the observation was censored at that point, as observations ended. In our graphs, which demonstrate how long it took for a show to go from Maximum Google Trends rating of 100 to Minimum Google Trends rating of 0, censored data means that the show has hit its maximum rating but has yet to go back down to 0 rating.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Chi-squared Tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>Chi-squared tests are statistical tests to determine if the difference between two variables is statistically significant. The test calculates the chi-square statistic, which measures the discrepancy between the observed and expected frequencies. If the chi-square statistic is sufficiently large, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant association between the variables.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Log Rank Tests</dt>
<dd>
<p>A log rank test is a statistical test to determine whether the survival rates of two or more groups are significantly different. The log-rank test compares the observed number of events (such as deaths or failures) in each group to the expected number of events.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ensemble Model</dt>
<dd>
<p>An ensemble model is a machine learning classification model that aggregates the results of multiple different ML models to create an overall decision. It works via a voting majority: if a majority of the models determine that an observation belongs to a given category, then the ensemble model will predict that the observation is part of the category.</p>
</dd>
<dt>XGBoost</dt>
<dd>
<p>XGBoost is a Machine Learning model which uses gradient boosted decision trees to help classify data into categories.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Confusion Matrix</dt>
<dd>
<p>A confusion matrix is a graphical representation of a classification model’s success. It shows the number of true instances of a given category and the number of predicted instances of a given category as a way to represent a model’s accuracy.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section id="survival-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survival-analysis">Survival Analysis</h2>
<p>As our main questions of interest involve determining how factors such as a show’s release schedule, genre, and streaming platform can affect the show’s ‘staying power’, we decided that using survival analysis would be an ideal path to answer these questions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we needed to identify a way to calculate a show’s staying power. To do this, we decided to use Google Trends data. This was chosen over Nielsen Ratings to simply give us more data points; many shows appear only a single time in the top 10 ranking. On the flip side, using Google Trends data, we have a few hundred data points for every show. As such, we felt that this additional depth would allow for a more consistent proxy for overall popularity. As we have Google Trends data for each show going back over the last 5 years, we determined that using Google Trends to be a proxy for a show’s staying power would be ideal. As a reminder, Google Trends data is normalized on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being equal to the time during the past 5 years when the TV show was searched for most often. To calculate the show’s staying power, we decided to look at the number of weeks that it took for a given show to go from a Google Trends rating of 100 (the maximum possible rating) to a rating of 0 (the minimum possible rating). This number essentially determines how long a show ‘survived’ in the public sphere. The great Ernest Hemingway was quoted as saying “Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name” <span class="citation" data-cites="hemingway">(<a href="#ref-hemingway" role="doc-biblioref">Hemingway, n.d.</a>)</span>. In our minds, every show has two deaths, when the last episode airs and the last time someone searches for its title on Google.</p>
<section id="streaming-platforms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="streaming-platforms">Streaming Platforms</h3>
<p>We first decided to look at the show’s streaming platform, to see if that had any significant impact on the length of time of a show’s popularity (<a href="#fig-7"><strong>Figure 7</strong></a>).</p>
<p>As the Kaplan-Meier curve in <a href="#fig-7"><strong>Figure 7</strong></a> shows, there is some difference between the streaming platforms. The two worst performing streaming platforms in terms of sustaining popularity are Peacock and Disney+. Peacock lags way behind the other streaming platforms; this can be attributed to Peacock’s relative unpopularity amongst streaming platforms. Peacock is the newest of all the streaming platforms tested, launching in July of 2020 <span class="citation" data-cites="comcast">(<a href="#ref-comcast" role="doc-biblioref">Comcast, 2020</a>)</span>. As such, it has not had the time to build up an audience or a reputation as a platform with good original programming. Disney+ is a more interesting example. Disney+ is a very popular streaming platform, but not very good at creating original content that sustains popularity. We hypothesize that this highlights the strengths of Disney+: the catalog of Disney content. Disney+ houses all sorts of Disney Channel shows, <em>Star Wars</em> films, and Marvel films, all of which could be argued are the main draw of Disney+ as a platform, not their original content.</p>
<p>To determine the statistical significance of the survival times by genre, we ran a log rank test. Running the log rank test gave us a p value of <strong>&lt;2e-16</strong>. As such, we can say with confidence that a show’s streaming platform is a significant influence on how the show’s popularity is sustained over time.</p>

</section>
<section id="genre" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="genre">Genre</h3>
<p>Next, we wanted to look at the genre of a show and how genres affected the shows’ staying power (<a href="#fig-8"><strong>Figure 8</strong></a>).</p>
<p><a href="images/survival_curve_genre.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-8" title="Figure 8: Comedy shows sustain popularity at higher rates than drama or docuseries shows"><img src="images/survival_curve_genre.png" id="fig-8" class="img-fluid" width="780" alt="Figure 8: Comedy shows sustain popularity at higher rates than drama or docuseries shows"></a> <em><strong>Figure 8</strong>: Comedy shows sustain popularity at higher rates than drama or docuseries shows</em></p>
<p>This Kaplan Meier curve tells some interesting stories. First, comedy performs much better than drama and docuseries from around the 10 week to 120 week mark. Meanwhile, docuseries and drama have a nearly identical curve the entire time. This goes counter to what we expected to see, as we thought that drama series would perform better than comedy series, as drama series are often watched “actively” whereas many comedy series are often watched as “comfort watching”. After all, drama and comedy are the two major categories at the Emmy Awards, the premier awards show for TV programming <span class="citation" data-cites="emmys">(<a href="#ref-emmys" role="doc-biblioref">Emmys, n.d.</a>)</span>. We also anticipated that these two genres would perform better than docuseries, and that there would be a larger difference in docuseries when compared with comedy or drama, due in part to how the shows are produced.</p>
<p>With a drama or comedy series (i.e.&nbsp;fictional shows), there must be a team of writers constantly working on writing new episodes and trying to keep things fresh and interesting while crafting an overall narrative arc. This is a very effort-intensive and time-consuming activity that is very hard to sustain over a long period of time. On the other hand, docuseries often can recycle the same ideas over and over again with new individuals. As a reminder, docuseries includes shows such as reality shows, game shows, and true crime docuseries. For example, one show in the docuseries category is the dating show <em>Love is Blind</em>. What is really different from one season to another other than the contestants? The format is the same, the show’s structure is the same, they just swap out the old contestants for new contestants. This difference makes sustaining a docuseries much easier than sustaining a drama or comedy show.</p>
<p>We ran a log rank test on our genre Kaplan-Meier curve as well, and this test resulted in a p value of <strong>&lt;2e-16</strong>. As such, we can say that genre absolutely plays a significant role in the sustained popularity of a given show.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="show-release-schedule">Show Release Schedule</h3>
<p>Finally, after seeing how a show’s streaming platform and genre can affect their staying power, we decided to look into the survival probabilities of the different release schedules (<a href="#fig-9"><strong>Figure 9</strong></a>).</p>
<p>This graphic provides some interesting insights. First, hybrid release schedules perform by far the worst in the beginning stages. This is interesting, as the different streaming platforms treat this release type differently. On Apple, the hybrid release is essentially the default release type at this point in time, whereas on Netflix, hybrid release schedules are reserved for the most high-performing and popular shows on the platform, such as <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em>. This likely is the cause for the relative low performance of the hybrid release type.</p>
<p>The all-at-once and weekly release schedules are fairly similar, with just a small difference in the middle section from about week 50-125, where all-at-once release schedules perform better. Interestingly, there’s very little difference between the shows in its first few weeks. We anticipated seeing a larger difference between the weekly and all-at-once releases in the show’s infancy, but there are very few differences detected.</p>
<p>Running a log rank test on the release schedules gives a p value of <strong>&lt;2e-16</strong>. As the release schedule, genre, and streaming platform are all statistically significant variables influencing popularity, we wanted to see how the combination of release schedule with these other factors influenced their survival probabilities.</p>

<section id="show-release-schedule-and-genre" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="show-release-schedule-and-genre">Show Release Schedule and Genre</h3>
<p>We first decided to look at the combination of show release schedule with show genre (<a href="#fig-10"><strong>Figure 10</strong></a>).</p>
<p>This graphic offers some interesting insights that the survival curves for genre and release schedule alone could not offer. It is apparent that every release type is not appropriate for every single genre. Weekly releases for comedy and drama shows are the worst performing of all genre + release schedule combinations. This goes along with our hypothesis that weekly releases are not good for building up a show’s popularity. Surprisingly, docuseries with weekly releases do the best at sustaining popularity. We were surprised by this, as we expected to see a higher popularity of all-at-once docuseries, due in part to their oftentimes low number of episodes and are covering time-sensitive issues. This likely has to do with the fact that there are only 9 total shows that are weekly released docuseries in our dataset, and two of those shows are extremely popular shows: <em>Last Week Tonight</em> and <em>The Grand Tour</em>. The success of these two shows skew our results a bit.</p>
<p>Drama releases are very interesting to compare. All at once drama releases sustain their popularity at the greatest rates, and hybrid release drama series are the worst at sustaining popularity, with weekly releases falling in the middle. This is contrary to what we hypothesized, thinking that a hybrid release would be the best of both worlds. When in reality, hybrid releases seem to be the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>Performing a log rank test on the survival curves gives a p value of <strong>&lt;2e-16</strong>. Therefore, we can say with confidence that the combination of release schedule and genre is statistically significantly impacting the length of time that a show sustains its popularity.</p>

<section id="show-release-schedule-and-streaming-platform" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="show-release-schedule-and-streaming-platform">Show Release Schedule and Streaming Platform</h3>
<p>We finally wanted to look at the survival probabilities of the different release schedules for each individual streaming platform (<a href="#fig-11"><strong>Figure 11</strong></a>).</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s clear to see that not every release schedule performs equally well for each streaming platform. In fact, we see each individual release schedule represented as both the best possible release schedule and the worst possible release schedule for at least one platform.</p>
<p>Some overall trends of note include that all-at-once releases are the worst performing for 5 out of our 8 streaming platforms. Hybrid and weekly release schedules tend to be the best performing for most platforms, with a few exceptions. Hybrid and all-at-once release schedules are the best for Netflix.</p>
<p>As with our other Kaplan-Meier curves, we performed a log rank test to determine if the results that we are seeing are in fact statistically significant. The log rank test gave us a p value of <strong>&lt;2e-16</strong>, so we can confirm that these results are statistically significant.</p>
<p><a href="images/survival_curve_schedule_platform.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-11" title="Figure 11: The ideal release schedule is different depending on the streaming platform"><img src="images/survival_curve_schedule_platform.png" id="fig-11" class="img-fluid" width="780" alt="Figure 11: The ideal release schedule is different depending on the streaming platform"></a> <em><strong>Figure 11</strong>: The ideal release schedule is different depending on the streaming platform</em></p>

<section id="machine-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>As we were looking at the yearly ratings table, we came across an interesting find: of all of the shows in the dataset, 8.91% (61/684) had their release schedules changed at some point in the show’s lifetime. Meaning, the show had multiple different release schedules, such as changing from releasing all-at-once to a hybrid release schedule. These changes occurred for the different seasons of a show. But of the shows that appeared in the yearly top 10 rankings for each streaming platform, 22% (55/250) had their release schedules changed.</p>
<p>We were interested in seeing if the difference in the proportion of shows with changing release schedule types in our overall dataset (61/684) vs shows that appeared in the Yearly Top 10 ranking for a given streaming platform (55/250) was statistically significant, so we ran a Chi Square test on these values. Running our Chi Square test, we found that the p value was <strong>7.501e-07</strong>. As such, we can say that this difference in the number of shows whose release schedules were changed is statistically significant.</p>
<p>We wanted to delve deeper into the changing release schedules and how those impact the popularity of a show. Therefore, we decided to create a Machine Learning model to predict whether a show appeared in a yearly top 10 ranking. After all, a great sign that a show’s popularity is sustained is that it was one of the 10 most watched shows on the streaming platform over the course of a year.</p>
<p>We decided to use an ensemble model consisting of four different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). These models were selected as they provided a good combination of modeling and performance, and so we felt that having these four models in our ensemble would produce the best results.</p>
<p>We wanted to specifically predict whether a show would appear in a yearly top 10. As such, we needed to balance our class weights. Only a small subset of the total number of shows in our dataset appeared on a yearly top 10, and as such, our class weights were very imbalanced. This led to our initial models having high overall accuracy, but achieving that high accuracy by simply predicting that essentially no shows would be in the top 10. Therefore, we balanced our class weights between those that appeared in a yearly top 10 and those that did not. We recognize and accept that this decision lowers our overall accuracy, but increases our accuracy within the shows that appear in a yearly top 10, which is what we want to predict.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the highest level of accuracy within our model, we performed both a test-train split to create a set of testing data to compare our model against, and we performed a cross validation to ensure that our model was performing consistently across different test groups. Our model used the following variables to predict whether or not a show was in a yearly top 10: genre, foreign language (if the show was in a foreign language or not), miniseries (binary variable of if show is miniseries or not), weeks in Nielsen (the total number of weeks the show appeared in a Nielsen top 10 ranking), and release_changed (whether or not the show’s release schedule changed over the course of its life). We had initially planned on including the show’s release schedule as a variable in this analysis, but ended up pivoting to the release schedule changing. This was due to the statistically significant difference in the proportion of shows in a Yearly Top 10 Ranking vs in the overall dataset whose schedules changed, as we wanted to see just how telling this change truly was.</p>
<p>When we ran our model, we had an overall accuracy of <strong>80.3%</strong>. This accuracy was consistent with our cross validation scores, all of which fell in the range of 78-82% accuracy. Our model returned the following confusion matrix on our test data (<a href="#fig-12"><strong>Figure 12</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Our model successfully classified 27 of the 34 total shows in our test dataset that appeared in a yearly top 10 ranking. The model inaccurately predicts that 27 shows would be in a yearly top 10 when in reality they were not in any such top 10 rankings. We accepted this over-predicting as we wanted our model to be as accurate as possible at predicting yearly top 10 shows, and were more concerned with that accuracy than the overall accuracy of the model.</p>
<p><a href="images/machine_learning_model.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-12" title="Figure 12: Our model correctly predicts 27/34 shows that appear in a Yearly Top 10 Ranking (numbers are lower than overall numbers due to splitting our data into a training set and a testing set; this Confusion Matrix reflects the results of our model on the testing data set)"><img src="images/machine_learning_model.png" id="fig-12" class="img-fluid" width="780" alt="Figure 12: Our model correctly predicts 27/34 shows that appear in a Yearly Top 10 Ranking (numbers are lower than overall numbers due to splitting our data into a training set and a testing set; this Confusion Matrix reflects the results of our model on the testing data set)"></a> <em><strong>Figure 12</strong>: Our model correctly predicts 27/34 shows that appear in a Yearly Top 10 Ranking (numbers are lower than overall numbers due to splitting our data into a training set and a testing set; this Confusion Matrix reflects the results of our model on the testing data set)</em></p>
<p>In order to further improve our model, we would like to introduce other variables such as critical reception and perhaps a sentiment analysis of posts about the show on various social media platforms. With these additional variables, we hope that our model would be even more accurate at predicting whether a show would appear in a yearly top 10 ranking.</p>

<section id="conclusions" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>The question this project set out to answer was “<em>Does the release schedule of a show (weekly, in parts, or all at once) impact their staying power?</em>” We mainly focused on the release schedule of a show. We also looked at extra contributing factors, including genre and streaming platform. We found that there is a statistically significant difference in how long a show’s popularity is sustained based on the streaming platform, the genre, and the release schedule. We also found that the combination of release schedule and genre is statistically significant for a show’s sustained popularity. Moreover, it appears that the success of shows depends on their streaming platform, and not all streaming platforms have similar successes; what release schedule is best for one streamer is often not the best for another streamer.</p>
<p>One variable we did not analyze was critical reception. While we analyzed various factors surrounding shows, we didn’t take into account how good the show is based on variables such as critical reception or award nominations. Shows can be released with the ideal schedule, on the ideal platform, and in the ideal genre to have the most popularity possible – but if viewers and critics don’t like it, it won’t succeed.</p>
