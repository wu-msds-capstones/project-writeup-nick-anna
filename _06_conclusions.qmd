# Conclusions

The question this project set out to answer was “*Does the release schedule of a show (weekly, in parts, or all at once) impact their staying power?*” We mainly focused on the release schedule of a show. We also looked at extra contributing factors, including genre and streaming platform. We found that there is a statistically significant difference in how long a show’s popularity is sustained based on the streaming platform, the genre, and the release schedule. We also found that the combination of release schedule and genre is statistically significant for a show’s sustained popularity. Moreover, it appears that the success of shows depends on their streaming platform, and not all streaming platforms have similar successes; what release schedule is best for one streamer is often not the best for another streamer.

One variable we did not analyze was critical reception. While we analyzed various factors surrounding shows, we didn’t take into account how good the show is based on variables such as critical reception or award nominations. Shows can be released with the ideal schedule, on the ideal platform, and in the ideal genre to have the most popularity possible – but if viewers and critics don’t like it, it won’t succeed.
