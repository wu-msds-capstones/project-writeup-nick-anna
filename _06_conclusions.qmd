# Conclusions

The question this project set out to answer was “*Does the release schedule of a show (weekly, in parts, or all at once) impact their staying power?*” We looked at multiple contributing factors, including genre and streaming platform. We found that there is a statistically significant difference in how long a show’s popularity is sustained based on the streaming platform, the genre, and the release schedule. We also found that the combination of release schedule and genre is statistically significant for a show’s popularity. Ultimately, we found that weekly releases are ideal for shows with preexisting fanbases, but are not ideal for newly released shows without a preexisting fanbase.
